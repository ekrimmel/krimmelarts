### David Krimmel
#### A community artist, museum exhibit designer, and aspiring body surfer who lives in San Diego, California.

My most recent work is _Sky Mosaic_, an art work commissioned by the NTC Foundation for ARTS DISTRICT Liberty Station, San Diego. Another notable art work was _whEAT hARvesT_. This project received national attention in the magazine Public Art Review, Food for Thought (Issue 46). _WhEAT hARvesT_ involved collaborations with a dance company, local urban farmers, and over 100 volunteers. Additional recent installations include two 48’ wide “swells” at the San Diego City College gallery sculpture courtyard, as well as a long-term installation of _Color Field Fence_ at the Art Produce Garden in North Park, San Diego.
